#Module1- Data-Driven
## Common Data pipeline questions
Does the organization have the data that addresses the need? Where is the data stored and in what format?  

Will I need to combine data from multiple sources?  

What is the type and quality of data? What will be the source of truth?  

What are the security requirements for this data? Who needs access to it and in what state?  

What types of mechanisms are needed to transfer the data from its locations into the pipeline?  

How much data is there, and how frequently is it updated or processed?
