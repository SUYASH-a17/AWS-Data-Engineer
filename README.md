# AWS-Data-Engineer

## Module1- Data-Driven Decisions
### More Valuable insights are more difficult to derive
Less Valuable ---> More Valuable
Descriptive --> Diagnostic --> Predictive --> Prescriptive
Descriptive: What happened?
Diagnostic: Why did something happened?
Predictive: What will happen?
Prescriptive: How can we make something happen or prevent from happening?

### Common Data pipeline questions
For Data Engineer,
Does the organization have the data that addresses the need? Where is the data stored and in what format?  
Will I need to combine data from multiple sources?  
What is the type and quality of data? What will be the source of truth?  
What are the security requirements for this data? Who needs access to it and in what state?  
What types of mechanisms are needed to transfer the data from its locations into the pipeline?  
How much data is there, and how frequently is it updated or processed?  

For Data Scientist,
What can the data tell me?  
How will I evaluate the results?  
What kind of visualization do I need?  
Which formats and tools are the analysts familiar with?  
Do I need a big data framework?  
Which type of AI/ML models fit?  
What is the simplest way to implement AI/ML?  

### The role of Data Engineer 
Both data scientist roles and data engineering roles work with the data pipeline, and tasks might be performed by someone in either role.  
Data engineering is primarily focused on the infrastructure that the data passes through while the data scientist works with the data in the pipeline.  
To build the right pipeline, you need to ask questions about the desired outcomes and the data and then iterate on your answers as you learn more.
